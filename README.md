Pneumonia Classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Overview
This project aims to develop a deep learning model to classify chest X-ray images as either normal or pneumonia. The model utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically 
learn discriminative features from the images and make accurate predictions.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of chest X-ray images obtained from the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset contains images labeled 
with pneumonia or normal.

Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Matplotlib
scikit-learn (optional for evaluation metrics)

Usage
Data Preparation: Download the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle and organize it into train, validation, and test directories. The directory structure should be as follows:

data/
├── train/
│   ├── normal/
│   └── pneumonia/
├── validation/
│   ├── normal/
│   └── pneumonia/
└── test/
    ├── normal/
    └── pneumonia/
Ensure that the images are named consistently and have appropriate labels.

Model Training 
Run the provided Python script (train.py) to train the CNN model using the prepared dataset. Adjust hyperparameters and architecture as needed.

Model Evaluation 
Evaluate the trained model on the test set to assess its performance. The evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score can be calculated using 
scikit-learn or custom evaluation scripts.

Deployment (Optional) 
Deploy the trained model as a web application or API using Flask, TensorFlow Serving, or TensorFlow.js for real-world usage.

Model Architecture
The CNN architecture used for pneumonia classification consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract and downsample features from the input images. The 
final layers include fully connected layers with dropout regularization to learn discriminative features and prevent overfitting. The output layer uses a sigmoid activation function for binary 
classification.

Results
The performance of the trained model on the test set achieved an accuracy of 90.25% and other relevant evaluation metrics.

Future Work
Fine-tuning hyperparameters and exploring different CNN architectures to improve classification performance.
Investigating transfer learning with pre-trained models to leverage features learned from other image datasets.
Scaling the model for deployment in real-world applications, such as healthcare systems, telemedicine platforms or PACS.
